I have modified the godfather code 
and also modified the respective heafer files

there are 3 functions which we can call

drawLogo(void)  ------- to draw Godfather Logo
logoAnimation(GLfloat)   --------- this is to animate the logo
logoFadeInEffect(void)   ---------- Fade in effect of logo


changes for speed and color 
//color changes
r_back,g_back,b_back ----------color for background 
r_front,g_front,b_front ----------color for foreground

initailly both the color are set to background color  0.4f
then after fade in foreground colors are incremented to 1.0f // white

//speed changes

speed of logo fadein is fixed but if you want to change then you can do it by changing in GodfatherLogoAPI.cpp in logoFadeInEffect() just increment/decrement hardcoded value to 

		r_front += 0.01f;  change the value 0.01f to accordingly for all these color values
		g_front += 0.01f;
		b_front += 0.01f;


speed of logo animation can be directlty handled in main.cpp 
there is global value named "change" it is GLfloat type increment or decrement it to adjust logo animation speed

Thank You!!!!!
